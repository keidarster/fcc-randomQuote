# fcc-randomQuote

This is the First intermediate Front End Development project from the freeCodeCamp Front End path.
I used an API for random programming quotes that is available in the following URL:
http://quotes.stormconsultancy.co.uk/api

For the styling of the app I used Materialize CSS framework: 
https://materializecss.com/

I used the basic card component for the entire content and the button.

Feel free to use the code.

Alles gute!
